## Our Vision

To be a globally recognized, student-driven cybersecurity research and training community that empowers individuals to excel technically, grow ethically, and serve society through innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.

## Our Sub-Teams

### Red Teaming
We simulate real-world attacks to uncover weak spots before adversaries do. Offensive security — hands-on, high stakes, and always evolving. We think like attackers, so defenders can stay ahead.

### Mobile Security
From tearing down mobile binaries to analyzing malware and exploiting flaws in mobile systems, we dig deep into how apps work — and where they fail.

### Blockchain Security
Decentralization doesn't guarantee safety — we prove that by uncovering logic bugs, exploitation paths, and design flaws in blockchain tech. We're deep in the code where trust meets risk.

### Cloud Security
We challenge the assumptions the cloud is built on. We dig into the gaps others overlook — misconfigurations, flawed logic, and hidden risks — and turn them into entry points.
